# hyndman_forecasting_exercises
A collection of R notebook containing code and explanations from Hyndman, R.J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2019) Forecasting: principles and practice, 3rd edition, OTexts: Melbourne, Australia. OTexts.com/fpp3.

These notebooks are classified as "self-study", that is, like notes taken from a lecture. For the written text of the notebook, much is paraphrased by me. I throw in relevant links for good measure. I try my best to quote the authors on specific, useful phrases. Credit for all of the examples and code go to the authors.

There is a separate subfolder that contains the exercises at the end of each chapter.

These examples use the R Package "fpp3" (Forecasting Principles and Practice version 3).

I also reference the 2nd edition of the book for specific topics that were dropped in the 3rd edition, such as hierarchical ARIMA.
