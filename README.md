# hyndman_forecasting_exercises
A collection of workbooks containing code for Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, Forecasting: Principles and Practice

Obviously, this is classified as "self-study" and I take no credit for any of this. Credit for all of the examples and goes to all of the author.

These examples use the R Package "fpp3" (Forecasting Principles and Practice version 3).
