# hyndman_forecasting_exercises
A collection of workbooks containing code for Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

This is classified as "self-study" and I take no credit for the content in any of the notebooks. For the writing portion of the notebook, much is paraphrased by me. I throw in relevant links for good measure. I try my best to quote the author on specific, useful phrases. Credit for all of the examples and code goes to all of the author.

These examples use the R Package "fpp3" (Forecasting Principles and Practice version 3).
