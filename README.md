# hyndman_forecasting_exercises
A collection of R notebook containing code and explanations from Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

These notebooks are classified as "self-study", that is, like notes taken from a lecture. For the written text of the notebook, much is paraphrased by me. I throw in relevant links for good measure. I try my best to quote the authors on specific, useful phrases. Credit for all of the examples and code go to the authors.

These examples use the R Package "fpp3" (Forecasting Principles and Practice version 3).
